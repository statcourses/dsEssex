\description{
The Pain Medication data is a modified data set from a randomized trial with 2 treatment
arms (existing drug and new drug) for 800 individuals. It contains two dosage levels per
treatment arm (low, high). The outcome is time to relief (hrs). In some subjects, no
relief effect was ever observed. For these subjects, Status=0 (censored). For subjects
where pain relief was observed, Status=1. The bseline and demographic measures include
age, gender and health status. Therefore, the following variables are represented in columns:
